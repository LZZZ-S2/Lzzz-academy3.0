<h1>R6 Classes</h1>
<p>So, you just installed Rainbow Six Siege and can’t tell the difference between a drone and a grenade? Still teamkilling in casual because you “thought that was an enemy”? Don’t worry. At LZZZ Academy, we’ve seen worse. Much worse.

This course is your official escape plan from Bronze Hell. We’re talking pixel-perfect peeks, sweaty callouts, and map knowledge so deep you’ll know what the enemy’s thinking before they even spawn. We’ll teach you the forbidden arts: pre-firing corners like you’ve got wallhacks, baiting attackers like it’s an artform, and holding site like your controller depends on it (because it does).

You’ll go from “where’s bomb B?” to shot-calling like you’re in the Six Invitational. Rage less, clutch more, and maybe—just maybe—get a teammate to actually say “good comms.”

By the end of this course, your aim will snap, your game sense will shock, and even the sweatiest Ash mains will tremble when they see your gamertag:
LZZZ-S2 Certified™.
