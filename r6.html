<p>🎮 R6 Mastery: From Bot to Almost-LZZZ-S2

Still crouch-walking around the map with your drone stuck in a plant pot? Can’t tell a rotate hole from a breach charge? Welcome, recruit. This course is for you.

We’re going to turn you from a bronze-tier liability into an almost-as-good-as-LZZZ-S2 Siege demon. No cap.

✅ What You’ll Learn:
	•	Map Knowledge
If you’re not pre-aiming Bakery door on Kafe or holding elbow on Oregon, you’re already dead. We’ll drill map callouts, choke points, and cheeky pre-fire angles until you can navigate blindfolded.
	•	Gunplay Mastery
Flick heads like your controller’s possessed. Learn recoil control, peeking with advantage, and when to hold versus swing. Bonus: we’ll teach you how not to panic-shoot your teammate’s kneecaps.
	•	Utility Usage
You’d be shocked how many players don’t know where to put Jäger’s ADS or how to use smoke’s canisters without hotboxing themselves. Fix that. Learn to burn utility like a pro, and waste enemy time like it’s an artform.
	•	Game Sense & Timing
Learn the rhythm of a round. When to push. When to rat. When to flank with Mozzie and ruin someone’s dream. Timing separates bots from legends — and you’re about to become nearly-LZZZ-level.
	•	Team Comms (Real Talk)
No one wants a mute teammate who only pings. Learn how to give crisp, clear, and useful callouts — and how to shut up when needed. Siege is chess with bullets. Start playing it like one.

By the end, you won’t just play Siege. You’ll breathe it. Sweat it. Live it.
Your aim will scare people. Your callouts will lead squads. And your enemies? They’ll pray you disconnect.

You won’t be LZZZ-S2, but damn… you’ll be close.
